# Tuya Adapter
Tuya Smart Life IoT devices adapter add-on for Mozilla WebThings Gateway communicating through Tuya Cloud.

# Notes
This add-on is based on <a href='https://github.com/unparagoned/cloudtuya/'>this</a> implementation of the Tuya Cloud communication protocol. In contrast to <a href='https://github.com/Galveston01/tuya-adapter'>this</a> adapter it only requires the username and password of the Smart Life App. But it does not run as stable, and I wasn't able to get light temperature and color mode working for light bulbs.
